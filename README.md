2D Android Game

Simple Mario is a 2D android game (based on a popular game series Super Mario developed by Nintendo) in which player/user can control Mario (character/avatar in the game) who can run, jump, and collect gold coin to increase score. He might encounter some obstacles like bombs and arrow on is way. If a arrow hits the avatar, it decreases his life and bombs are more dangerous which on collision causes death, therefore ending the game. 

Playerâ€™s goal is to help Mario collect as much as gold coins possible to increase the score and dodge obstacles on his way. 

Built using Lib-gdx framework.
